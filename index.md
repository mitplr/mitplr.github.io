# MIT Programming Languages Review

The mission of the MIT PL Review is to highlight recent developments that we believe have significant potential to shape the future direction of PL research and/or industry practice. We aim to select papers that may substantially transform the PL community and beyond, with a focus on emerging trends rather than established lines of research. We favor papers whose contributions are broadly accessible (and likely to be appreciated) across the PL community, but we do not limit the papers to those published at PL venues. Our selection process is not meant to provide an objective evaluation of works but rather to highlight and celebrate works that resonated with our committee members.

Please stay tuned for our 2025 program details!
